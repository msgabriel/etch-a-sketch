## Etch-A-Sketch
Browser version of Etch-A-Sketch, from The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

I changed the requested "hover" effect to "click and drag", and added the color input, to make the drawing process easier and more enjoyable.
